### Do's

- Include specific details (prices, dates, terms)
- Use active voice ("We set up" not "Setup is performed")
- Address customer needs directly
- Include calls to action

### Don'ts
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Don't oversell or use excessive exclamation marks
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Avoid vague statements ("best quality" → specify what makes it best)
- Don't ignore accessibility (use clear, readable language)
